# RetherzTargetTracker
Raid target symbol tracking and targeting with debuff tracking.
```/rtt``` or ```/retherztargettracker``` to configure.

#Limitations
Vanilla is highly limited with tracking targets. To be able to target these units you must have a raid member targeting it. 
To be able to track debuffs timers accurately the player applying the debuff must have the addon and use a script to cast the spell.
